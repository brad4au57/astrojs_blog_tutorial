While I’m often known for my portraiture, watercolor still life offers a serene and intimate way to study form, light, and color. The transparency of watercolor allows for subtleties that bring even the most mundane objects to life.

## Tips for Still Life Painting

1. **Select Simple Subjects**: Start with fruits, flowers, or everyday objects. The goal is to focus on composition and light.
2. **Play with Shadows**: Use water to create soft gradients for shadows. This adds depth and realism to the scene.
3. **Embrace Negative Space**: The untouched paper is as important as the painted areas. It creates contrast and highlights the delicacy of your subjects.

Watercolor invites intimacy. Each stroke is a balance between control and release. Through this medium, I’ve discovered the beauty in simplicity and the power of restraint.
