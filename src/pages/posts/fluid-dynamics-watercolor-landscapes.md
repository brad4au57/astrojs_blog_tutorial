There is a unique vibrancy to painting landscapes with watercolor. The fluid nature of the medium mirrors the organic forms of hills, trees, and skies, creating a connection between the artist and the natural world.

## Steps to Create Dynamic Landscapes

1. **Start with the Sky**: Paint the sky first to set the mood and atmosphere. Use wet-on-wet techniques for soft clouds and gradients.
2. **Build Layers**: Begin with distant forms like mountains, then move forward, adding trees, fields, and details.
3. **Embrace Texture**: Use dry brush techniques to add texture to trees, rocks, and grass.

Watercolor landscapes are about movement and energy. Let the paint flow, and allow the unpredictable nature of water to bring a sense of life to your work.
