Light is the soul of any watercolor painting. It defines the form, creates atmosphere, and brings life to the subject. When painting with watercolors, understanding how to balance light and shadow is essential to creating depth and realism.

## Techniques to Harness Light in Watercolor

1. **Reserve Whites**: Use masking fluid or leave areas of the paper untouched to represent highlights.
2. **Layer Transparently**: Build shadows gradually with transparent layers to maintain luminosity.
3. **Soft Edges**: Blend wet edges to create natural transitions between light and dark areas.

Watercolor demands precision but rewards patience. Let your highlights breathe and let the shadows speak softly. With practice, the interplay of light in your paintings will evoke a sense of realism and wonder.
