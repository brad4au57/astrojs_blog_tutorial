Watercolor is a medium of ethereal beauty, capable of capturing the interplay of light and shadow with unparalleled transparency. Unlike oils, watercolors allow the paper to become an active participant in the artwork. By letting the light reflect through the paint and off the paper, one can achieve a luminosity that mimics the natural world.

## My Approach to Watercolor

1. **Start with a Light Wash**: I begin with a soft, diluted wash to establish the mood. The colors should flow seamlessly, creating a harmonious base.
2. **Build Gradually**: Layering is key. Allow each layer to dry before applying the next, ensuring the transparency remains intact.
3. **Leave Room for Spontaneity**: The unpredictable nature of watercolor can lead to happy accidents. Embrace them; they often bring life to your work.

Let your brush dance with the water. Paint not only what you see but what you feel. The soul of watercolor lies in its ability to convey emotion through simplicity.
