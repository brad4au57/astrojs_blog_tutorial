Watercolor is a medium that invites both precision and unpredictability. As an artist, your challenge is to strike a balance between controlling the paint and letting it flow freely. This delicate balance can lead to truly unique and expressive works of art.

## Tips for Finding Balance in Watercolor

1. **Plan Your Composition**: Begin with a loose sketch or idea of your layout to guide your work.
2. **Allow for Movement**: Use plenty of water and let the paint flow, but guide it with a tilt of the paper or a gentle brush.
3. **Focus on the Essentials**: Avoid overworking the painting. Sometimes less is more in watercolor.

Watercolor allows me to explore the boundaries between form and abstraction. It’s not about perfection but about expressing an idea or feeling through color and flow. Let the process guide you and see where it takes you.
